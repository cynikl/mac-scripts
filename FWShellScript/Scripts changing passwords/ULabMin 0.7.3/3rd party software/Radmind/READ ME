Radmind is what we recommend you use to update your computers.  It allows you to 
quickly (well, once you have learned how to use it) push out updates to 
computers, which is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED if you want a safe lab, especially 
considering that there have been several security vulnerabilities discovered in Mac OS X that required a quick update.

In other words, we don't think ASR is not a good solution for doing updates (but 
is great for initial installation...).

If you don't install radmind edit the file ulabmin_perl_config.pl and change 
$radmind_master to "".

Install iHook if you install radmind or else none of the radmind features will 
work right.

Radmind is free (see license file for more information).

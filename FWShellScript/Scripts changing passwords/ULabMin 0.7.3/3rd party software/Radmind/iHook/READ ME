Inside of the iHook-app folder is the modifications we have made to iHook.  You 
will need to use those if you intend to use the images for iHook we have created 
that are located at:

If you plan on using radmind, install iHook or else some radmind stuff wont work 
right.  iHook isn't used for any thing other than radmind in ULabMin (but it 
might be added to the startup item in the future, especially in 10.4).

Install iHook in /Library/ULabMin/Private/tools/

iHook is free (see included license file for more information).

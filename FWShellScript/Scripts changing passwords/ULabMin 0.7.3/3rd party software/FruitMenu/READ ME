Use FruitMenu to modify the Apple Menu.  We use FruitMenu to remove "Logout" 
from kiosks.  We also use it on our lab computers to use our own Logout app 
rather than the system's.

Application Enhancer is required if you use FruitMenu.

None of the scripts require FruitMenu.

It is really nice to create a FruitMenu Items folder with aliases to common 
software.  Use the Fruitmenu Preference Pane to do that.

FruitMenu IS NOT FREE (it has a demo mode that goes into "expired" mode after a 
period of time).  It costs about $10 per license.

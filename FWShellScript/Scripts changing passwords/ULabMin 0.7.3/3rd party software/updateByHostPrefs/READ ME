The version of updateByHostPrefs that is part of ULabMin is older than what is 
on Leon Towns-von Stauber's website.  We  have modified this script to take a 
path instead of a username.

See included license file for more info.  The actual script is located at 
/Library/ULabMin/Private/scrips/updateByHostPrefs.sh.

SecureIt replaces the file /etc/rc.boot.  ULabMin's "Extra Security" files also 
replace this file.  Use the ULabMin version, not SecureIt's.

To do that, you will need to keep a copy of the ULabMin version, remove the 
version that SecureIt creates, and move the ULabMin version back after 
installing SecureIt.  Or you can just install SecureIt before installing 
ULabMin.

SecureIt is free (see license file for more information).

To install Screen Preserver, just drag Screen Preserver to 

/Library/ULabMin/Private/tools/

Images for Screen Preserver go inside of it:

Screen Preserver.app/Contents/Resources/Pictures/

You will need to create the Pictures folder.  If you just want a black screen, 
just create a 1024 x 768 black image.  If you want it to cycle through images, 
create lots of 1024 x 768 images.  There is no point making images bigger unless 
you disable these 2 resolution settings found in /etc/ulabmin_perl_config.pl:

$startup_setdisplay_resolution_switch
$logout_setdisplay_resolution_switch

If these 2 settings are enabled, when the computer is logged out (which is when 
Screen Preserver runs), it will always be 1024 x 768.

Screen Preserver is free (see included license file for more information).

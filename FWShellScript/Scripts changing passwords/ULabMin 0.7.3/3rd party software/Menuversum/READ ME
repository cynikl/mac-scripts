The Prefpane for 10.3.zip is the Menuversum prefpane that has been updated for 
10.3.  Note, the prefpane still doesn't work in System Preferences, inside of 
the prefpane are files that Menuversum uses, so this update is required.

If you don't install Menuversum, please edit /etc/ulabmin_perl_config.pl and set 
$enable_menuversum to 0.

Menuversum is included in the same folder as this readme because the developer 
has removed it off of his website--but he plans on updating it.

Menuversum is free (see included license file for more information).

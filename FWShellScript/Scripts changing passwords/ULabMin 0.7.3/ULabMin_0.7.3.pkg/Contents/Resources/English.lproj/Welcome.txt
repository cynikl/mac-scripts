******** AVOID COMPLETELY REINSTALLING THE OS ********

DON'T JUST INSTALL AND REBOOT!  YOU WILL REGRET IT.

                   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! READ THE README !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you don't read the README, you may have to completely reinstall the OS of this computer if you proceed!

ULabMin TOTALLY messes with the operation of the OS.

DO NOT INSTALL THIS ON A PRODUCTION COMPUTER.

ULabMin Extra Graphics (last updated 2004.09.14)

You probably want to change all of the logos in these files...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BootPanel.psd

BootPanel needs to be saved as a PDF.  It should not be transparent.  Save the file to:

	/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemStarter/QuartzDisplay.bundle/Resources/BootPanel.pdf

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

loginpanel_10.3.x.psd

The login window graphic needs to be saved as a transperent tif file that has no layers.  It needs to be transparent (where you want the background to show--hide the "Backgrounds" layer folder before saving the file as tif, and don't save layers).  Save the file to:

	/System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgent.app/Contents/Resources/applelogo.tif

You must use the ULabMin version of the login window nib because it modifies the size of the "applelogo.tif" graphic.  Apple's default size is very small.  See:

/System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/loginwindow.bundle/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/login.nib

You can, of course, modify ULabMin's nib with Interface Builder.  Inside of login.nib is a file objects.nib.  You must copy this file to:

/etc/ulabmin/objects.nib

performing_maintenance.psd

This file is for iHook and Radmind.  Save as gif.  It has 5 layer folders named Step1, Step2, Step3, Step4, and Step5.  Only show one at a time when saving it as gif.  It needs to be transparent (where you want the background to show--hide the "Background" layer folder before saving the file as tif).

This graphic file requires a modified iHook nib, which is included with in the "3rd party applications" folder.

Put the files at /Library/ULabMin/Private/resources named
	performing_maintenance1.gif
	performing_maintenance2.gif
	performing_maintenance3.gif
	performing_maintenance4.gif
	performing_maintenance5.gif
